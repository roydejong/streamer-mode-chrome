Streamer Mode for Chrome
===

***Streamer Mode* is an extension for Google Chrome that can help you censor certain information in the web browser.**

- Turn streamer mode on or off to hide sensitive information
- Hide any set of elements on any webpage (using CSS selector rules)
- Actually replaces text on the page, so it can't be accidentally selected or copied either
